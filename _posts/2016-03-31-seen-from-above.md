it is certain that being taller lends a different view.  one could see 
beyond the clutter.  one could see further past the immediate block.  is
it greater?  probably not, simply a different view. by 
being above the city-line, the vastness of a city is more easily seen.  
the capacity we possess to affect our immediate surroundings, in a very 
profound way, becomes more evident.
