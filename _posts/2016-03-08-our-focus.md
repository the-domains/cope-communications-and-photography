# our focus

CoPe | communications & photography is a brand focused on life, love, fashion, design, and wine.  the motivation for CoPe | is to engage life through these five lenses in order to ameliorate the perspective of others.

CoPe | communications & photography was officially founded in 2009\.  having lived in Prague, Paris, Toronto, and now residing in Calgary, CoPe | continually engages realities through new lenses.  CoPe | is derived from an original thought in 2006 and is the fusion of Comfort and Peace that was experienced while intently engaging music to rationalize personal upheaval.  CoPe | prevailed and continues to engage various media to live a contented and meaningful existence.

the desire within CoPe | communications & photography is to preserve the integrity and function of language and images as these media create reality for the viewer.
