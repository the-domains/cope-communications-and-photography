# our focus

CoPe | communications & photography is a brand focused on creative writing, inspiring images, and affective media.  the motivation for CoPe | is to enhance and ameliorate the perspective of others through positive language and great images.

CoPe | communications & photography was officially founded in 2009\.  After living in Prague, Paris, Toronto, and now residing in Calgary, CoPe | continually enjoys seeing realities through new lenses.  CoPe | is derived from an original thought in 2006 and is the fusion of Comfort and Peace that was experienced while intently engaging music to rationalize personal upheaval.  CoPe | prevailed and continues to engage various media to live a contented and meaningful existence.

the desire within CoPe | communications is to preserve the integrity and function of language as it creates realities.  as such, all attempts are made to retain simplicity, precision, and style.

in similar fashion, CoPe | photography wishes to preserve the integrity of the scene while increasing photographic skill.  therefore, the majority of images produced are minutely touched by editing software.  primary adjustments made to a scene are completed through the functionality of the camera and simple touch-ups.   thus, the CoPe | photographer is continually adjusting and interacting with shutter speed, depth of field, and ISO sensitivity to produce that perfect image.
