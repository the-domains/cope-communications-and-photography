            <description><![CDATA[<p>i’m not one for the spotlight.  i’d rather impact with subtlety, with verve, in the background.  i arrived a bit later to the game.  i was busy doing my own thing.  i was unconventional.  this was the path that i chose.  the answers eventually became more clear, as they have always been inside and waiting to be extracted.  it just required a little extra time.  but the lessons were there.  and the ideal state of affairs became reality.</p>]]></description>
